# Recipe Keeper
I have created a web app where users can create and save their recipes favourite  in a single online location.

# :computer: [Click here](https://recipe-keeper.fly.dev/) to see my live project!

# :page_facing_up: About
- Simply create an account to create your own recipes.
- Once you've signed up, click the 'create new recipe' tab to build your own.
- Fill out at least all the required fields and click 'save'.
- You can also like recipes that other users have created.
- Your liked recipes will be saved to the 'Liked Recipes' tab.
- You do not need to log in to peruse through other users recipes.

# :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- I started out planning all the features that I wanted to add to the website.
- I then split them into core features and additional features, based on their necessity for getting the web app up and running.
- Based on this list I considered and planned the data types I would be using and how best to store them.
- I then planned my wireframe based on the features and data I wanted to present.

# :rocket: Cool Tech
- Ruby, HTML, CSS
- PSQL
- Sinatra
- BCrypt

# :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- add in additional features to round out user experience

# :sob: Lessons learnt
Learning how to store and retrieve list information of unknown size in a database was tricky, especially when also being able to display it on the webpage in a usable and appropriate format. This was the most challenging part of the project for me was this data manipulation in psql.

# :white_check_mark: Future features
- Search bar to search for user recipes by keywords
- Ability to add ingredients to a user shopping list
- Ability to tick off ingredients and directions as you complete them while cooking
- Users can comment on other user's recipes
